The underlying mathematics and algorithms worked, but they existed only as scripts in an obscure university tool (similar to MATLAB), designed for producing isolated research graphics, not end-user software."

          "text": "The situation had deteriorated: the researcher had parted ways with his original developer, leaving no path forward. The \"prototype\" had no user interface, required hardcoded parameters, and relied on copy-pasted code variants for different input scenarios. It could not be distributed, demonstrated to agencies, or operated by anyone outside the lab. The researcher believed he was close to a finished product; in reality, he had a proof-of-concept with no industrial foundation."

The new method promised to automate this using remote sensing data, but only if the software could be reliably operated by forestry professionals, not just the researcher himself."
