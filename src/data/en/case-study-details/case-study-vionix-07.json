The project was well underway—design was polished, user flows were functional, and a launch date had been agreed. But no one had planned how the webshop would connect to the live rental management system. The web developer had built the storefront in isolation, with no visibility into the company's existing IT infrastructure, database architecture, or API requirements. When the rental company contacted Vionix to \"connect the two systems,\" it became clear that integration hadn't just been deferred—it hadn't been scoped at all."
