Vionix redesigned the hardware stack, collaborated with interior fitters to integrate ventilated enclosures into sales counters, and established annual deep-cleaning cycles that reduced failures from multiple per week to 1-2 per quarter."

For years, the retailer off-the-shelf desktop PCs - equipped with barcode scanners, receipt printers, cash drawers, and network cards - sat exposed on or beneath counters. When the chain operated 20 stores, a single failure per month was tolerable. But as the network grew to 80+ locations, failures multiplied linearly with store count, then accelerated as aging hardware compounded dust ingress. By the time Vionix was engaged, multiple terminals were failing daily or weekly across the estate."

Maintenance was eventually handed to a specialist partner under Vionix supervision, ensuring long-term sustainability without permanent dependency."
