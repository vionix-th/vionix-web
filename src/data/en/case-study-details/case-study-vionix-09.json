All developers worked simultaneously in a shared source directory on a single terminal server—management believed this prevented IP theft. Service cases exceeded 20 per day; deployments were trial-and-error exercises; Windows updates routinely broke the development environment."

Developers shouted across the office hunting for whoever \"broke\" the system. Regression was constant but untraceable. The gap between development and release branches spanned thousands of unexplained lines of code. Customer deployments had no scripted installers; technicians fought through errors on-site until the system booted. Post-deployment service spikes lasted weeks."

Every Windows update triggered days of trial-and-error reinstallations. The Sales Director—who led software development despite no technical background—resisted change. Long-tenured developers were hostile to object-oriented programming and unwilling to learn. Projects were implemented as isolated, customer-specific code with zero reusable abstraction."
