Every night, a custom-built transformation process would extract data from the ERP database, restructure it, calculate derived metrics, and load it into a separate SQL Server dedicated to BI reporting. The front-end—a functional UI using List & Label for report generation—was well-accepted by customers."

Rapid Discovery and Hypothesis Testing (10 Days) Vionix audited the existing transformation logic and examined the SQL queries the BI system executed against the secondary database. Within days, the pattern was clear: missing indexes caused full table scans, and the \"complex\" transformations were straightforward JOINs and aggregations. The nightly ETL existed solely because the team believed real-time was impossible—not because it actually was."

          "type": "p",
          "text": "2. Proof of Concept with SQL Views Vionix built a prototype that replicated 2-3 of the most commonly used BI reports using SQL Views on the source ERP database. The views abstracted the data preparation layer—implementing proper JOINs, adding calculated fields (inventory levels, average sales prices), and leveraging stored procedures where complexity warranted. Vionix used SQL Server's query optimizer and execution plans to identify exactly which indexes were missing, then added them to the live tables."

          "type": "p",
          "text": "3. Performance Validation in Parallel Vionix ran both systems side-by-side: the legacy nightly ETL and the new real-time Views. This allowed direct data comparison to ensure accuracy and provided a safety net. Load testing under production-like conditions (tens of millions of records for the largest customers) confirmed negligible impact on ERP INSERT/UPDATE operations. Exclusive locks were minimal; daily business workflows remained unaffected."

          "type": "p",
          "text": "4. Developer Buy-In Through Collaboration The original developers initially resisted—their transformation system was being dismantled. Vionix reframed the conversation: rather than assigning blame, Vionix positioned them as essential partners in the migration. Once they saw the prototype's simplicity (updating a SELECT statement in a View versus debugging thousands of lines of brittle transformation code), enthusiasm replaced resistance. The new approach was objectively easier to maintain."

          "type": "p",
          "text": "5. Full Migration and Knowledge Transfer Over the remaining weeks, Vionix systematically migrated all BI data structures to the View-based architecture. Vionix ensured feature completeness, then conducted structured training sessions—presentations, tutorials, and walkthroughs with the development team. They took notes, asked questions, and received the materials as references. Code comments served as inline documentation; no separate manuals were requested or required."

If the real-time approach had failed, the client could have reverted. It didn't. By the time the migration completed, the team's confidence in the new architecture was absolute."
