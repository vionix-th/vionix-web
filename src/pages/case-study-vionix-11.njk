<h1>Bridging the Gap: Digitalising Goods Receipt on Legacy Hardware</h1>

<h3>Snapshot</h3>
<p>
<strong>Delivery model:</strong> Principal-led engagement (Stefan, Founder &amp; Principal Consultant)<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> <span class="anonymized-client-label">Atlas Heavy Industries</span> (German regional operation in a global heavy-equipment network)<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> The client operates central warehouses responsible for processing significant volumes of incoming heavy machinery parts. They had already invested in ruggedised Windows CE handheld scanners but lacked the software infrastructure to make them functional.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The client warehousing operations were dependent on paper-based workflows. Staff manually recorded goods receipts on clipboards and later keyed the data into the ERP system, a slow process prone to transcription errors.</p>
<p>While the hardware strategy was in place (Windows CE scanners had already been procured), the software strategy was missing. The client's existing ERP system offered no native mobile interface or API suitable for handheld devices. The challenge was to build a bridge between modern mobile hardware and a rigid backend system that wasn't designed to support it.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Legacy Operating System:</strong> The target devices ran Windows CE, requiring development on the older .NET Compact Framework (.NET 3.5).</li>
<li>
<strong>User Proficiency:</strong> The warehouse staff were not technical users. The interface had to be drastically simple to ensure adoption and prevent confusion.</li>
<li>
<strong>Vendor Resistance:</strong> The ERP provider did not natively support third-party mobile devices, creating potential friction in defining the interface.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The project moved from concept to deployment in three months.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> Vionix facilitated a concept phase with the client's IT lead to define the workflow. Crucially, Vionix engaged the ERP vendor management early to formalise the interface specification, bypassing initial resistance from their support teams.</li>
<li>
<strong>Robust Protocol Selection:</strong> Vionix implemented a SOAP-based interface. This choice provided strict type safety within the constraints of the .NET Compact Framework and ensured seamless integration with the ERP's existing technology stack.</li>
<li>
<strong>Targeted Development:</strong> Vionix built a bespoke client application in C# (.NET 3.5), strictly optimising for the limited resources of Windows CE.</li>
<li>
<strong>&quot;Zero-Training&quot; UX Design:</strong> Vionix designed the user interface to be minimalist and linear, guiding the user through the scan-and-book process without requiring knowledge of the underlying system.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What Was Delivered</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Custom Windows CE Application:</strong> A native application optimized for specific handheld hardware.</li>
<li>
<strong>SOAP Middleware:</strong> A stable communication layer bridging the handhelds and the ERP.</li>
<li>
<strong>Operational Training:</strong> On-site training for warehouse staff on device usage and for IT administrators on device configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>100% Digitalisation:</strong> The manual paper-and-clipboard process was eliminated immediately upon go-live.</li>
<li>
<strong>Long-Term Stability:</strong> The system has proven to be exceptionally stable, running for over five years with zero software-related support tickets.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resilience:</strong> In the only recorded incident during the system lifecycle, a sudden failure of all devices, our investigation quickly identified a client-side network misconfiguration, proving the software integrity remained intact.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why It Worked</h3>
<p>
<strong>Simplicity over Features</strong>
<br>By stripping the mobile interface down to its absolute essentials, Vionix removed the barrier to entry for warehouse staff. The software didn't try to replicate the ERP; it only exposed the specific function needed (goods-in).</p>
<p>
<strong>Defensive Engineering</strong>
<br>The choice of SOAP and strict type safety meant the integration was rigid but reliable. This architecture contributed to the &quot;silent runner&quot; nature of the project, where the software continues to function year after year without maintenance.</p>

<h3>How Vionix Worked</h3>
<p>
<strong>Managing Multi-Vendor Politics</strong>
<br>The project relied on the cooperation of the client ERP vendor. Their support team was initially reluctant to support third-party hardware. By escalating the technical architecture discussions to the vendor management, Vionix secured the necessary cooperation to build a reliable interface, eventually handing over backend maintenance to them completely.</p>
