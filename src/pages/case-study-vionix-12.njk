<h1>Turning a Black-Box Legacy System into a Company-Wide Delivery and Support Operating System (Jira Cloud)</h1>

<h3>Snapshot</h3>
<p>
<strong>Delivery model:</strong> Principal-led engagement (Stefan, Founder &amp; Principal Consultant)<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> <span class="anonymized-client-label">Ironbridge ERP</span> (German ERP vendor for equipment trade and rental)<br>A mid-market German ERP vendor serving industrial equipment trade and rental modernised its internal project and service-case management after years of ad-hoc, interrupt-driven work and low organisational IT maturity.<br>Vionix led a five-month engagement (2-month development pilot + 3-month company rollout) with a 35-person organisation and handed over full administration at the end.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The client relied on an in-house management system for project work and service cases that forced unrealistic 15-minute time tracking and encouraged shadow processes like paper notes and batch-entered time blocks, so reported effort didn't match reality.</p>
<p>Change documentation was effectively manual and frequently skipped, leaving developers with little visibility into colleagues' work and creating a siloed &quot;everyone works in a black box&quot; dynamic.</p>
<p>Support intake and assignment lacked consistent triage and transparency: tickets could be self-classified (new vs duplicate), assigned arbitrarily, then disappear, forcing repeated customer explanations and constant manual chasing of blockers.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>The company culture was heavily sales-led, with limited engineering and project-management expertise across leadership, which made governance and prioritisation hard to sustain.</p>
<p>The initial mandate was to modernise development without formally redesigning support and consulting processes, even though the pain spanned the whole operating model.</p>
<p>The legacy system was also not tamper-resistant (anyone could edit or delete history), which had created a print-and-archive culture to protect against manipulation and disputes.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Diagnose the real operating model:</strong> Conducted interviews and meetings across teams to confirm that project and service management, not coding practices alone, was the core bottleneck.</li>
<li>
<strong>Run a controlled pilot in development:</strong> Introduced Jira Cloud as the source of truth for delivery, while dual-running the legacy system only for intake and closure marking during the pilot.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reduce friction and increase traceability:</strong> Trained developers to link version-control commits directly to Jira issues, replacing manual write-what-you-changed admin work with auditable workflow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Make prioritisation a daily, explicit decision:</strong> Implemented short daily briefings to review and reorder priorities so developers could plan their day and work with fewer interruptions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stop drive-by tasking:</strong> Established strict routing rules. Support, sales, and consulting could not assign work directly to developers; requests went through development leadership and Jira.</li>
<li>
<strong>Align business and engineering daily:</strong> Set up a daily coordination meeting between development leadership and sales and consulting leadership to reconcile customer reality with delivery capacity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fit Jira to reality:</strong> Iteratively tuned Jira workflows during the pilot to reflect how work actually moved through the organisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Delivered artifacts included the Jira Cloud configuration and training materials (presentations used for internal enablement sessions).</p>

<h3>What Was Delivered</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Jira Cloud operating model:</strong> End-to-end company rollout replacing the legacy internal management system.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workflow governance:</strong> Routing and prioritisation rules that removed direct developer interruption patterns.</li>
<li>
<strong>Traceable delivery process:</strong> Commit-to-ticket linkage and auditable work history for development and service work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enablement artifacts:</strong> Training sessions, presentations, and admin handover for sustained internal operation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Within the pilot, developer morale improved and complaints about constant interruption and unstructured work dropped sharply. Developers regained focus because daily expectations became predictable.</p>
<p>The company reduced reliance on paper, saving an estimated 500-1000 printouts per month, because Jira provided better history and transparency than the editable legacy system.</p>
<p>Support and consulting gained enough visibility to communicate concrete status and blockers to customers, which improved customer satisfaction, especially through clearer answers and better service reporting (for example, monthly service volume and recent trends).</p>
<p>A key organisational outcome was stabilised attrition: newer developers were less likely to quit early once the work stopped feeling chaotic and opaque.</p>
<p>The final adoption hurdle was support leadership resistance (fear of losing &quot;tribal knowledge&quot; advantage and concern about a new tool). Targeted one-on-one coaching shifted buy-in in roughly two weeks, enabling the full rollout.</p>
<p>After three additional months, the entire company operated in Jira Cloud and the 20-year legacy system (built on early .NET) was retired, with the client taking full ownership of administration and ongoing management.</p>

<h3>Why It Worked</h3>
<p>
<strong>Whole-system diagnosis over narrow tooling fixes</strong>
<br>The bottleneck was not just development tooling; it was the operating model across development, support, and consulting.</p>
<p>
<strong>Pilot-first de-risking</strong>
<br>The controlled development pilot proved value early while preserving rollback safety, making broader adoption feasible.</p>
<p>
<strong>Behavioral rules, not just software configuration</strong>
<br>Routing rules, daily prioritisation, and leadership alignment removed structural interruption patterns that software alone would not solve.</p>
<p>
<strong>Targeted adoption work</strong>
<br>Focused coaching on the final resistant stakeholder group converted blocking resistance into operational buy-in.</p>

<h3>How Vionix Worked</h3>
<p>Vionix ran a five-month solo engagement, starting with a two-month pilot in development and followed by a three-month company-wide rollout. Work combined facilitation, process design, configuration, and team coaching. Administration and ongoing governance were fully handed over at the end.</p>
