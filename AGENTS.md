# AGENTS.md

Purpose: guide consistent, privacy-safe edits to the Vionix website.
This is a static site. Keep changes simple, durable, and template-aligned.

Scope:
- Governs site structure, presentation, and integration of Markdown-sourced content.
- Case studies are generated by a separate system with independent instructions.
  Do not restructure or “improve” their narrative unless explicitly instructed.

---

## 1) Non-negotiables (Project invariants)

### Privacy
- Do not publish real client names or identifying details.
- Avoid “fingerprints” (unique counts, niche combinations) that enable inference.
- Prefer ranges/abstractions over precise numbers when needed.

### Accuracy / No invention
- Do not fabricate claims, metrics, clients, timelines, or credentials.
- If a critical detail is missing, add: `<!-- MISSING: ... -->` rather than guessing.

### Consistency
- Keep terminology and taxonomy consistent across pages (headings, CTAs, footer lists, filters).
- Avoid parallel/alternative names for the same thing.

---

## 2) Template & stack (implementation rules)

- Use Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons, and the BizLand template assets/styles.
- Preserve the template’s layout, responsiveness, and animations.
- Keep everything compatible with static hosting.
- Reuse existing template pages/patterns; do not modularize HTML into partials.
- JavaScript only (no frameworks, no TypeScript).

---

## 3) Structural requirements

- Maintain key components: header, footer, contact form, CTA sections.
- Navigation and menu links must match the actual site structure.
- If business-critical data is missing, request it or use `<!-- MISSING: ... -->`.

---

## 4) Markdown integration

- Business content comes from Markdown sources (plans, competency profiles, resumes, testimonials, etc.).
- Manually rewrite Markdown into high-quality, semantic HTML that fits the BizLand template.
- Do not build tooling to auto-convert Markdown.

---

## 5) Taxonomy invariants (must be used verbatim)

Canonical service pillars:
- `Database & Reporting Performance`
- `Legacy Core Stabilisation`
- `Incremental System Modernisation`
- `Efficient Team & Workflow Enablement`

No alternate names or abbreviations anywhere.

Icon mapping:
- Database & Reporting Performance -> `bi-code-square`
- Legacy Core Stabilisation -> `bi-arrow-repeat`
- Incremental System Modernisation -> `bi-robot`
- Efficient Team & Workflow Enablement -> `bi-mortarboard`

---

## 6) “When in doubt” rule
Prefer:
- fewer changes,
- factual wording,
- template consistency,
- privacy safety,
- and leaving unknowns as `<!-- MISSING: ... -->`.
